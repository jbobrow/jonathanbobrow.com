A smart tabletop game system where each piece is an autonomous game console. Snap together magnetic hexagonal tiles to play dozens of games with friends.

Each Blink is a standalone computer that communicates with its six neighbors through infrared light. Games emerge from simple local rules — no central controller, no phone required. Just pick up and play.
